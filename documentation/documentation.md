#Documentation

Here are 2 folders gathering miscellaneous docs (mainly RFCs and
Thesis) about SDN and IP mobility that can be useful for the project,
feel free to add whatever you think interesting for us even stuff that
you've written yourself. May be we will need to think about a way to
name all this docs properly for an (even) better organization.

Note may, 07:

In prevision of the report writting a new folder is set entierly
related to the final report construction.

NOTE march, 17:

I have found a draft on the IETF  website (document called
DMM_SDN_optimization) that is a first step toward the integration of
DMM within SDN managed network. It's not very technical and doesn't go
deeply in the details, but it's a good material for starting a
reflection.
